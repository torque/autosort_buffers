Automatic, case-insensitive buffer sorting alphabetically by network. Intended to act similarly to the way KVIrc sorts its channels/queries. Best used with [buffers.pl](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/buffers.pl.html/)—the visualization keeps buffer order from becoming confusing.

Currently very much untested. Buffers created by plugins other than irc may be moved unexpectedly.
