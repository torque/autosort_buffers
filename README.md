Automatic, case-insensitive buffer sorting alphabetically by network. Intended to act similarly to the way KVIrc sorts its channels/queries. Best used with [buffers.pl](http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/buffers.pl.html/)—the visualization keeps buffer order from becoming confusing. Also, setting `irc.look.server_buffer = independent` is recommended. Merged buffers aren't guaranteed to be handled gracefully.

Requires Weechat 0.3.7.
